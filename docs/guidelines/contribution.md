# Contributing
Contributions of any kind are very welcome! Doesn't matter if you want to add a new feature, endpoint, or improve documentation, any kind of help is greatly appreciated, no need to ask.

### There are a few things to keep in mind though.
- When contributing, please try to follow the [code style guidelines](codestyle.md)
- Please document your code! You don't need to document everything, but using XML comments is necessary to keep the documentation complete and up to date
- I make mistakes! Don't be afraid to overwrite code from others, if you think that your way is better
- Try to maintain support for older codebases; No one likes it when they update their dependencies and everything breaks
